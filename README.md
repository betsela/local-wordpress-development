# Getting Started developing locally

A Mac users guide to getting started with developing WordPress sites locally on your computer. Unfortunately this guide is aimed to mac users, and many of the concepts will not transalte to PC's just because the operating systems do not support the same features. Some parts and concepts will work cross platform.

## Using Homebrew `brew` to manage OS pacakges

### Quickstart -> install
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Why brew?

Brew is a package manager. A package what? It manages tools your mac will need at its core, the most common package for developers is GIT. Instead of following long guides of typing CLI commands and configuring files in directories you can never remebmer, you can now have these tools "automatically" threw brew. Brew is considerably different today, then it was several years ago. Throw out your previous notions of brew and just give it a try.

## Install brew packages we will use as developers

### Quickstart -> install all packages
#### Suggested for Development
```bash
brew tap caskroom/cask && \
brew install grc git svn node imagemagick pkg-config hub && \
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain 
brew cask install virtualbox vagrant vagrant-manager
brew cask install iterm2 sequel-pro 
```
#### Recommended for productivity
```
brew cask install phpstorm slack
brew cask install alfred spectacle flux dash imageoptim clipmenu
brew cask install filezilla google-chrome parallels-desktop spotify snagit
```

## Setup Bash Profile and Features
Setting up your terminal profile is very important for productivity. We recommend the following enhancements. Being by opening your bash profile configuration file. 

### Using terminal to setup .bash_profile
```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```
Then copy the following and past it into the terminal text editor we just used to open the file.
```bash
alias ls="ls -GHf"
alias ll='ls -lartG'
alias xdebug_on='vagrant ssh -c "xdebug_on" | grep php'
alias xdebug_off='vagrant ssh -c "xdebug_off" | grep php'
alias hosts='sudo nano /private/etc/hosts'
alias flushdns='sudo dscacheutil -flushcache'
alias vup="vagrant up --provision"
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
alias showFiles='defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app'
alias hideFiles='defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app'
alias pruneknownhosts="sed -i -e s/*.*//g ~/.ssh/known_hosts"
alias prunedevhosts="sed -i -e s/.*\.dev.*//g ~/.ssh/known_hosts"
alias updaterepos='ls | xargs -P10 -I{} git -C {} pull'

# REST HELPER
httpHeaders () { /usr/bin/curl -I -L $@ ; }

# docker functions
alias dke="docker exec -i -t"
alias dkps="docker ps -a"
alias dkls="docker images"
dkRun () { docker run -dit $@ ; }
dkBuild () { docker build . -t $@ ; }
dkClean () { [[ $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) ]] && docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) ; }
dkCleanImages () { docker rmi $(docker images | grep "^<none>" | awk '{print $3}') ; }
```

Lastly save and close the file with `Ctrl+X` then `Enter` and one more `Enter`.

### Using terminal to setup .inputrc
Input RC controls what happens as you type in terminal. We are going to setup a feature that allows terminal to use "per command history". When in terminal you can hit the up and down arrows to cycle through previously used commands. With this extra configuration file, it will allow you to track "per command" history. So if you typed "git push" then "cd www", you may want to only search your history for "git" commands. To do so, simply type "git" and then press up, it will only search your history for git commands and find "git push" as desired.

Open the .inputrc file from terminals nano editor:
```
nano ~/.inputrc
```

Then copy and paste the following into the editor.
```
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[A": history-search-backward
set completion-ignore-case On
```

Lastly save and close the file with `Ctrl+X` then `Enter` and one more `Enter`.

### Enabling new terminal profile features

The easiest way to enable new terminal features is to restart terminal, or open a new terminal tab. You can however, alternatively force your current terminal sessions profile to be updated with
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Setup your SSH key pair

Only needed if you haven't already generated an SSH private key (id_rsa) and public key pair (id_rsa.pub) before.

### Generate an ssh key pair
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/

### Understanding SSH key pairs

If you do not already have a ssh key pair, you need to generate at least one pair. Key pairs are like deadbolts & keys. Your “private key” is like your house key, it only works when used with your houses deadbolt lock. The “public key” is like the deadbolt lock on your house. The pair, the key and the deadbolt, together allows you secure access into your home. 

In the case of SSH key pairs, you keep the private key to yourself, never share this with anyone else. You share your public key with, well anyone who needs to grant you access to there servers. When they add your public key (deadbolt) to their servers, it’s like giving you your own backdoor into the servers that only your private key works with. (Ever seen the keymaker in the Matrix movie? Kind of like that).

## Configure your ssh forwarding agent

https://developer.github.com/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/#setting-up-ssh-agent-forwarding

### Example for connecting to Pagely Hosting
Open terminal editor nano for .ssh config file:
```
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Then copy and paste the following into the editor.
```
Host *.pagelydev.com
     ForwardAgent yes
Host *.pagelyhosting.com
     ForwardAgent yes
```
Lastly save and close the file with `Ctrl+X` then `Enter` and one more `Enter`.

### Understanding forwarding with the ssh agent

Basically, when you are using SSH or SSH tunnels, you need to "grant access" to your private key. This allows us to pass our SSH key to the remote server we are connecting to, and it can now use your key to "forward" your requests to additional servers that it may talk to. You don't want to allow this for "just every server you connect to". That would be dangerous since you need to trust the connecting server not to abuse the use or sharing of your private key. Remember your private key, the one without .pub at the end, is like a password. Do not share your private key with anyone, and we highly recommend you do not "sync it to a cloud drive service". Certainly never store it in a Github repository, regardless of the repo is private or public.

## Setup dnsmasq for VVV development

### Configuration of dnsmasq
This assumes you use the standard VVV with virtualbox and the default IP.
Install: dnsmasq was installed above, if you skipped it `brew install dnsmasq`
Setup (https://echo.co/blog/never-touch-your-local-etchosts-file-os-x-again): 

```
brew install dnsmasq
mkdir -pv $(brew --prefix)/etc/
echo 'address=/.dev/192.168.50.4' > $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo echo "admin enabled - quickly do sudo tasks"
```

Next type your password in the prompt before continuing.
Now hurry a little, you only have 10 minutes to copy and paste the following commands
```
sudo cp -v $(brew --prefix dnsmasq)/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/dev'
```

### Testing dnsmasq config

Test if dnsmasq is working by typing the following and hoping for a successful response of a local IP address:
```
ping -c 1 -t 1 google.dev
```

Expect results like:
```
PING google.dev (192.168.50.4): 56 data bytes
--- google.dev ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss
```

## Install Variable VVV Site Wizard- Called VV
- Install via homebrew
- create config file for location reference 
- pull the blueprint from repo
- -maybe pull vv hooked companion files
```
brew install bradp/vv/vv
```
_Note: when you do your first VV create below, if you do it from the ~/Sites/VVV folder it will automagically setup your .vv-config file._

## Setting Up WordPress Development

Fully setting up local WordPress development of a custom site isn't that complicated, but its complex enough that we don't want to try do a comprehensive explanation in readme file. 

If your intention is just to walk yourself through a "new custom local development site for WordPress". You can use the VV wizard by typing `vv create` in terminal and answering all the prompts. Occassionally your build might fail to install WordPress. If this happens use the following command to manually run the installation:
_Note: Make sure you are in your VVV directory when executing these commands. Also, you will need to replace a portion of this command to match the site name you gave your new site during the VV wizard._

```
vagrant ssh -c 'cd /srv/www/localwp.dev/ && bash vvv-init.sh
```

We have prepared a shared a sample shell script that we use as a boilerplate when building a custom local provision thats intended to match a production website. We call these "staging provision scripts". The concept is to mirror your production site, as close as possible, for local development. That includes sample content (but real looking sample content), site options, settings, themes, plugins, etc. The shell script we prepared is *not* intended to provision your local dev site for you, instead its supposed to help you layout your own privision script that you will build and test on your own.

## A few manual things to install/setup
- Plugins for PHPStorm: dash, gfm, .ignore
- PHPStorm->prefs->editor->code style->php->”Set From…”->Wordpress
- `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
- `git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`
- Finder-> prefs-> new finder at “choose user dir” and then setup favorites sidebar

## Migrating SSH Keys

When moving to a new computer, it's often helpful to migrate your SSH keys as well. These are the `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` files located in `~/.ssh`. The files can simply be copied over between machines, but after copying you'll need to reset permissions on the `id_rsa` file to ensure servers will continue to accept it (copying these files can reset the read/write permissions). 

To correct the permissions, run the following in terminal after you've copied the files over:

```
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
